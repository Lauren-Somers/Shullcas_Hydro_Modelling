# Shullcas_Hydro_Modelling
Code and data for Shullcas River integrated hydrological modelling using GRASS-GSFLOW and glacier melt module

Shullcas_12_1 contains input and output filed for GSFLOW for integrated modelling from 1998 to 2018
Shullcas_12_2 is the same as Shullcas_12_1 except the model was run without glaicer melt to calculate the glacier contribution

Glacier_Melt_Module is commented Matlab code for calculating glacier melt and area based on meteorological and glacier hypsometric data in the Data folder
